For example, if an asset such as holdings of a particular share is worth Rs 100 but is given a haircut of 20%, it means it is treated as though it has a value of only Rs 80.Here is the link to the NSE haircut list - <a href=""https://www1.nseindia.com/products/content/equities/equities/homepage_eq.htm"">https://www1.nseindia.com/products/content/equities/equities/homepage_eq.htm</a><strong>VAR Margin:&nbsp;</strong>Value at Risk margin is a measure of risk. It is used to estimate the probability of loss of value of a share or a portfolio, based on the statistical analysis of historical price trends and volatility. Based on the VAR margin, stock exchanges calculate the risk of loss in the value of a stock, typically with a one-day time horizon.<br>A stock with a 10% VAR margin requirement means that there may be a potential loss of 10% in the value of the stock in one day with a given level of confidence&mdash;say 99%. VAR margin is published by the exchanges multiple times during the day, based on the movement in the price of a stock. VAR margin is used to apply haircuts on stocks by many entities such as banks, which provide loans against shares.&nbsp;"

Clearing corporations will randomly take 4 snapshots at predefined time windows for arriving at such peak margin requirements on open positions during the day. The highest margin requirement from these 4 snapshots will be the Peak Margin. This aims to curb the excessive leverage for intraday and derivatives positions.Intra-day positions will now need upfront margins. Also, if a trader falls short of these margins during the session, he would be liable to pay a penalty.&nbsp;<strong>HOW PEAK MARGIN AFFECTS PAYOUT -</strong>You will get a maximum 80% payout of your available cash margin after deducting the peak margin.&nbsp;Let&#39;s understand it with the below <strong>example</strong> -Your peak margin of a specific day is Rs 10 lakhs.The available cash margin is Rs 15 lakhsAvailable cash margin - Peak Margin = Gross payout amount1500000 - 1000000 = 500000 RsSo you will get a payout of 80% of 500000 that is Rs 400000 (Net Payout amount).<strong>Note -&nbsp;</strong>- In case your peak margin is equal to or higher than your available cash margin, your payout will be rejected for that specific day.&nbsp;- Even if you have squared off your positions, still payout will be calculated on the basis of the peak margin rule.&nbsp;- You can check your peak margin in Shoonya &quot;View Limit&quot; option."

Member may retain 50% of end-of-the-day (EOD) margin requirement as cash margin, excluding the margin on consolidated crystallized obligation/ MTM.iii. Apart from the 50% cash margin mentioned in point ii above, a member may also retain 225% of EOD margin (which includes an additional 125% margin) reduced by 50% cash margin and the value of securities (after applying appropriate haircut) accepted as collateral from the clients by way of &lsquo;margin pledge&rsquo; created in the Depository system for the purpose of margin and value of commodities (after applying appropriate haircut).&nbsp;<br><strong>For example -</strong> Say, you have Rs. 2,25,000 in your account and have taken four lots of security X with a required margin of Rs. 25,000 per lot. So, Rs. 1,00,000 would be blocked from your account, leaving a balance of Rs. 1,25,000. As per the rules, the broker has to maintain a 225% balance for the open position held by you. In this example, you need to maintain the total margin of Rs. 2,25,000 (1,00,000*225%). As the fund available in your account is only Rs. 2,25,000, your account will be marked as retained, and the broker will not refund any amount to your account.<br><strong>Kindly note -</strong>-Kindly note that, if the first Friday of the quarter is a trading holiday, then &ldquo;such settlement shall happen on the previous trading day&rdquo;.-The client can re-transfer the funds on the same day after getting the payout."

Trading,2019-12-26 06:43:30,336,What is BTST?,"<strong>BTST (Buy Today Sell Tomorrow)</strong>In a&nbsp;<strong><strong>normal equity delivery trade&nbsp;</strong></strong>(buy/sell of stocks using CNC order), the transaction is complete in T+2 days where T is the day of trading. The buyer gets shares in his Demat account and the seller gets money in T+2 days. So, if you buy some shares of a company on Tuesday, the shares will be credited to your Demat account on Thursday. While counting T+2 days, holidays in exchanges are excluded. So, if there&#39;s a holiday in between then the delivery period is extended.What if you got an opportunity to book the profits or losses in between those 2 days? You cannot take this opportunity as it&#39;s a normal order. This may result in losses for the trader.BTST solves this problem of traders by allowing them to buy or sell their securities before these are credited to their Demat account. This helps traders to benefit from short-term volatility in the price of the stocks.Finvasia provides a BTST facility.&nbsp;"
