Here is the link to the NSE haircut list - https://www1.nseindia.com/products/content/equities/equities/homepage_eq.htm
VAR Margin: Value at Risk margin is a measure of risk. It is used to estimate the probability of loss of value of a share or a portfolio, based on the statistical analysis of historical price trends and volatility. Based on the VAR margin, stock exchanges calculate the risk of loss in the value of a stock, typically with a one-day time horizon.
A stock with a 10% VAR margin requirement means that there may be a potential loss of 10% in the value of the stock in one day with a given level of confidence—say 99%. VAR margin is published by the exchanges multiple times during the day, based on the movement in the price of a stock. VAR margin is used to apply haircuts on stocks by many entities such as banks, which provide loans against shares.",,,,,,

","You can use collateral margin in Equity cash-Intraday, Futures, options (Selling), CDS & MCX. You cannot use it for options buying and equity delivery.


",,,,,,
"What is the intraday margin available for equity shares?
","As per SEBI regulations on peak margins, starting September 1, 2021, intraday leverages have been reduced to ensure 100% of the margin required is collected for all Equity and derivative positions.



The minimum margin for equity intraday trades will be 20% of the trade value based on the volatility of the stock(VaR+ELM+Adhoc margins of the exchange). So you will get up to 5 times intraday leverage in the equity cash segment.



For example, you have 1 lakh rupees in your account and want to buy ITC shares (Intraday).

Leverage in ITC: 5X

You can buy up to 100000*5 = 500000 Rs of shares.

So for buying shares of 5 lakhs, you should have only a 20% (approx) margin that is 1 lakh rupees.

What is Peak margin and how does it affect Payout?,"Peak Margin is the minimum margin that MUST be collected by brokers from their clients in advance of placing any intraday/delivery order in the Cash and derivatives segment. Clearing corporations will randomly take 4 snapshots at predefined time windows for arriving at such peak margin requirements on open positions during the day. The highest margin requirement from these 4 snapshots will be the Peak Margin. This aims to curb the excessive leverage for intraday and derivatives positions.

Intra-day positions will now need upfront margins. Also, if a trader falls short of these margins during the session, he would be liable to pay a penalty. 

HOW PEAK MARGIN AFFECTS PAYOUT -

You will get a maximum 80% payout of your available cash margin after deducting the peak margin. 

Let's understand it with the below example -

Your peak margin of a specific day is Rs 10 lakhs.

The available cash margin is Rs 15 lakhs

Available cash margin - Peak Margin = Gross payout amount

1500000 - 1000000 = 500000 Rs

So you will get a payout of 80% of 500000 that is Rs 400000 (Net Payout amount).

Note - 

- In case your peak margin is equal to or higher than your available cash margin, your payout will be rejected for that specific day. 

- Even if you have squared off your positions, still payout will be calculated on the basis of the peak margin rule. 

- You can check your peak margin in Shoonya ""View Limit"" option.

Can I pledge my shares without POA to get the collateral margin?,"Yes, you can pledge the shares in favor of TM/Clearing Member without any POA (Power of Attorney) to get the collateral margin.

For getting the collateral margin, 50% of the margin needs to be compulsorily available in cash or cash equivalent collateral. The ratio of cash margin & collateral margin should be 50:50.

For example, if You have shares worth Rs 1,00,000 & the NSE haircut is 20%. You can now pledge all these shares in favor of Finvasia & get a collateral margin of Rs 80000.

Option 1: - If you have a cash margin of Rs 30000 in your account you can use a total margin of 60000 (Rs 30000 Cash margin + Rs 30000 collateral margin).

Option 2: - If you have a cash margin of Rs 80000 in your account you can use a total margin of 160000 (Rs 80000 Cash margin + Rs 80000 collateral margin).

Option 3: - If you have a cash margin of Rs 100000 in your account you can use a total margin of 180000 (Rs 100000 Cash margin + Rs 80000 collateral margin).

If you don’t maintain a sufficient cash margin and the shortfall is funded by non-cash collateral, there will be delayed payment charges on the shortfall.



Please Note-

-You will only be able to pledge shares already in your demat account.

-The pledge option will not be available for T1 holdings.

-You can pledge your holdings only if you have the equity derivatives segment (F&O) activated in your account. You can activate your FNO segment by raising a ticket in PRISM.

-You would be required to select the segment in which you want to use the collateral margin. For example, if you want to pledge your stocks for trading in Futures & Options segment.

What is the new quarterly Settlement or Running Account Settlement process?,"To safeguard the interest of the investor/trader, SEBI mandated all stockbrokers to reverse any funds that are lying in the trading account back to the Bank account of the client. 
As per the SEBI Circular, effective Oct 1, 2022, the settlement of running account of funds of the client shall be done by the trading member “after considering the end of the day (EOD) obligation of funds as on the date of settlement across all the exchanges on the first Friday of the quarter (i.e., Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec, Jan–Mar) for all the clients. 

Please refer to the table below to understand quarterly settlement dates. 

1st Friday of July

1st Friday of October

1st Friday of January 

1st Friday of April



What is the value of funds that a trading member can retain while doing the settlement?

In case of a client has any outstanding trade position on the first Friday of the Month / Quarter on which settlement of running account of funds is scheduled, a Trading member may retain funds calculated in the manner specified below:

i. Entire pay-in obligation of funds outstanding at the end of the day on the date of settlement, across all segments.

ii. Member may retain 50% of end-of-the-day (EOD) margin requirement as cash margin, excluding the margin on consolidated crystallized obligation/ MTM.

iii. Apart from the 50% cash margin mentioned in point ii above, a member may also retain 225% of EOD margin (which includes an additional 125% margin) reduced by 50% cash margin and the value of securities (after applying appropriate haircut) accepted as collateral from the clients by way of ‘margin pledge’ created in the Depository system for the purpose of margin and value of commodities (after applying appropriate haircut). 



For example - Say, you have Rs. 2,25,000 in your account and have taken four lots of security X with a required margin of Rs. 25,000 per lot. So, Rs. 1,00,000 would be blocked from your account, leaving a balance of Rs. 1,25,000. As per the rules, the broker has to maintain a 225% balance for the open position held by you. In this example, you need to maintain the total margin of Rs. 2,25,000 (1,00,000*225%). As the fund available in your account is only Rs. 2,25,000, your account will be marked as retained, and the broker will not refund any amount to your account.



Kindly note -

-Kindly note that, if the first Friday of the quarter is a trading holiday, then “such settlement shall happen on the previous trading day”.

-The client can re-transfer the funds on the same day after getting the payout.",,,,,,

Does Shoonya provide advisory services or tips?,"No, we do not provide tips and advice for trading.

",,,,,,
What are Cover order and Bracket order?,"Cover order - Order for intraday trading where a SL order is placed parallel to the main order. This Stop Loss Order cannot be canceled. Since the Stop Loss Order is being placed simultaneously while getting into the contract, the risk that is being taken automatically reduces.

Bracket Order-It is a 2 leg order for intra-day trading. Both SL and TP are placed parallel with the main order. If any of the SL / TP orders is executed, then the other order is auto-canceled.

There are no charges for bracket orders and cover orders in Shoonya.

How to check stock purchase price?,"Once you have bought the shares then their purchasing value or price will reflect in your trading platform, contract note, and in the back office.
",,,,,,
What is BTST?,"BTST (Buy Today, Sell Tomorrow)

In a normal equity delivery trade (buy/sell of stocks using CNC order), the transaction is complete in T+2 days, where T is the trading day. The buyer gets shares in his Demat account, and the seller gets money in T+2 days. So, if you buy some company shares on Tuesday, the shares will be credited to your Demat account on Thursday. While counting T+2 days, holidays in exchanges are excluded. So, if there's a holiday in between, the delivery period is extended.

What if you got an opportunity to book the profits or losses between those 2 days? You cannot take this opportunity as it's a normal order. This may result in losses for the trader.

BTST solves this problem of traders by allowing them to buy or sell their securities before they are credited to their Demat account. This helps traders to benefit from short-term volatility in the price of the stocks.

Shoonya provides a BTST facility. 


",,,,,,
What is an Option Chain?,"An options chain is a table displaying options quotes for a particular underlying security. The options chain matrix is updated in real-time showing the last price, trading volume, and best bid and offer for the calls and puts of an options series, typically segmented by expiration date.

An option's strike price is also listed, which is the stock price at which the investor buys the stock if the option is exercised.

",,,,,,
What is the difference between CE and PE?,"CE and PE stand for “Call option” and “Put option” in the stock market which is the derivative contract that gives its owner the right and not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed-upon price within a certain time period.

Call option offers its holder or the buyer the “right to buy” a particular asset at the agreed-upon price i.e. the strike price on or before the expiration date in return for a premium paid to the seller or the writer of the option contract.

Put option offers its holder or the buyer the “right to sell” a particular asset at the agreed-upon price i.e. the strike price on or before the expiration date in return for a premium paid to the seller or the writer of the option contract.",,,,,,
What is the difference between futures and cash markets?,"FUTURE MARKET - A future market is a place where only futures contracts are bought and sold at an agreed date in the future and at a predefined price. You can never be a shareholder when you trade in Futures. No delivery takes place as the Future contract expires on the expiration date. Only margin money required to be paid for initiating the Future contract. One has to buy a minimum lot size which is already defined. Such as in the case of NIFTY lot size is 75. In futures, you have to settle the contract on the expiration date i.e. maximum of three months.
In a future contract, you are not entitled to any dividend

Can be a shareholder for F&o stocks like reliance, Bhel, etc, only non-deliverable contracts are of an index like nifty.
CASH MARKET

A cash market is a marketplace in which securities purchased are paid for and received at the point of sale. For example, a stock exchange is a cash market because investors receive shares immediately in exchange for cash.
Demat settlement of T+2 days takes place on account for bought holding and client become a shareholder of a stock company. It is done on T+2 days.
The full amount needs to be paid at the time of buying shares in cash. One can buy even a single share of a company.  ",,,,,,
What is GTT order?,"GTT (Good till triggered) is a feature that allows you to set a trigger price, such that if your trigger price is hit on a future date, a limit order will be placed on the exchange as per the limit price and preset conditions set by you.

GTT is available for Shoonya for all the segments. If wants to palace sell GTT order then the account needs to be linked with POA first. The validity of GTT is up to 1 year.
Is It Useful?
GTT orders make your trading/investing experience more convenient. Here’s how they prove beneficial:
You do not need to log in every day to place a limit order during the trading session.
You have more flexibility in terms of placing an order with a longer horizon in mind.
Your monitoring efforts are reduced. If you are an investor who is looking to sell/buy a desired quantity of shares at the desired price within a custom time frame, without half the effort – GTT is your best bet.",,,,,,
What is dividend?,"Shareholders earn returns on their investment in equity in two ways; the first being capital appreciation and the second by receiving dividends that companies pay to their shareholders.
A dividend is a payment made by a corporation to its shareholders. If you’re a shareholder, you can think of a dividend as your share of the company’s profits.

You will be eligible for dividends If you’ve purchased the stocks before the ex-date. If you've purchased the shares on or after the ex-date, you will not be eligible for the dividend.

These payments are usually made in cash which is known as a cash dividend but in some cases, they may choose to make these payouts in the form of stocks too which is known as a stock dividend. The client will get dividends in his linked bank account with the Demat account. 

The dividend yield is often an essential factor for investors when choosing which stocks to invest in. The dividend yield is calculated on the current share price.
Example: If ABC Ltd declares a dividend of Rs.5/share and the market value of the share is Rs.250 then:
Dividend Yield = Full-year Dividend/Current Share Price
In this case it is: 5/250 = 0.02 or 2%  ",,,,,,
How many GTT orders can I place for one account?,There is no limit to place GTT orders but it will check the margin available when the price triggers.,,,,,,
What is an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)?,"An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or other assets, but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock. ETF share prices fluctuate all day as the ETF is bought and sold; this is different from mutual funds that only trade once a day after the market closes. ETFs offer low expense ratios than buying the stocks individually.

An ETF (Exchange-traded fund) is a basket of securities that tracks an underlying index. For example, a Nifty 50 ETF tracks the composition of the Nifty 50 Index. When you buy a Nifty ETF, you are getting exposure to the 50 stocks that form the Index.
",,,,,,
What are OTM options?,"""Out of the money"" (OTM) is an expression used to describe an option contract that only contains an extrinsic value. These options will have a delta of less than 50.0. An OTM call option will have a strike price that is higher than the market price of the underlying asset. Alternatively, an OTM put option has a strike price that is lower than the market price of the underlying asset.

OTM options have less extrinsic (time) value than ITM options, which in turn makes them more desirable to traders with smaller amounts of capital. OTM options are more commonly traded for strategies such as covered calls or protective puts.

You can trade in OTM options with Shoonya (3 months contracts). There are no restrictions on the trading of OTM options with us. 

",,,,,,
What is Short selling?,"Short selling is the selling of a stock that the seller doesn't own. More specifically, a short sale is the sale of a security that isn't owned by the seller, but that is promised to be delivered. Short selling is an investment or trading strategy that speculates on the decline in a stock or other security's price.

You can short sell in equity (Intraday only) & derivatives (Intraday & carry both). ",,,,,,
What happens when I dont squared off my short position?,"In case your Intraday Equity short position is not squared off due to the absence of buyers or failed due to any reasons. This will be considered as short delivery, which means the seller of the shares has defaulted on the settlement of shares hence the exchange participates in the auction market on T+2 days. The exchange holds an auction for the same quantity of shares & delivers it to the buyer.

The settlement of the auction shall be done on T+3 day (where T is the transaction day, holidays are not included).

Short delivery can happen in stocks with less liquidity or if an Intraday Equity position hasn’t been squared off in some circumstances. As a result, appropriate margins would be blocked in your account. The blocked amount will be released once the auction settlement process is completed on T+3.",,,,,,
What is OFS and how we can apply for the same?,"A private company launches an Initial Public Offering (IPO) for additional funding. The company sells shares to outside investors to access funds for various purposes. This includes the growth and expansion of the company. 

However, the company’s financial problems do not end with an IPO. Sometimes, a company may need additional capital to meet its goals. That’s the time such companies can opt to go for an Offer for Sale (OFS).

An offer for sale (OFS) is a mechanism that allows promoters to reduce their holdings in listed companies transparently. These shares sold by the promoters are offered for sale directly to the public through a bidding process.

The client can place an OFS order from 9.15 am to 3 pm.

What will happen to trades and investments if PAN and Aadhaar are not linked?,"Restrictions on Trading and Investment if PAN and Aadhaar Cards are Not Linked
Restrictions if the PAN & Aadhar cards are not Linked.

As per the directives issued under the Exchange Circular No. NSE/ISC/56173, it is mandatory to link your PAN with your Aadhaar Card. In case of failure to link your PAN and Aadhaar card can result in restrictions on buying and selling on these exchanges and the freezing of your Demat Account at CDSL.

How long does updating the status when PAN is linked to Aadhaar usually take? 
To ensure that you can start trading, the exchanges (NSE, BSE & MCX) and the depository (CDSL) must mark your PAN and Aadhaar as operative in their records. The updating process typically takes up to 30 working days for each entity, as they rely on external sources for verification.

When are funds unblocked if the IPO was not allotted?,"Funds are typically unblocked after the allotment of shares. If your IPO application was not allotted any shares, the timing for unblocking your funds typically follows a specific schedule. It's important to be aware of the key dates and steps involved in this process:

For instance, let us take the example of Ratnaveer Precision Engineering IPO, which has an opening date of September 4, 2023. In this case, if your application is not allotted any shares, your funds will follow this schedule:

1. IPO Opening Date (Monday, September 4th, 2023): The opening day is when you can start submitting your IPO application.

2. Close Date (Wednesday, September 6, 2023): This is the last day for submitting your IPO application.

3. Cut-off time for UPI mandate confirmation (5 PM on September 6, 2023): It's important to note that certain banks might unblock the funds only after the mandate end date, which, in this case, is 5 PM on September 6, 2023. This is the date when the UPI mandate for your IPO application ends.

4. Basis of Allotment (Monday, September 7th, 2023): After the IPO closes, the basis of allotment is determined. This process involves allocating shares to investors based on various factors, including the number of shares applied for and the demand for the IPO.

5. Initiation of Refunds (Tuesday, September 8th, 2023): If your IPO application was not allotted any shares, the initiation of refunds to your bank account begins on this date. The funds you had blocked for your application will start becoming available.

6. The credit of Shares to Demat (Wednesday, September 8th, 2023): If you were allotted shares in the IPO, they would be credited to your demat account on this date.

7. Listing Date (Thursday, September 11, 2023): The IPO shares of Ratnaveer Precision Engineering will be officially listed and available for trading on this date.

So, in this case, if you didn't receive any allotment in the Ratnaveer Precision Engineering IPO, you can expect your funds to start getting unblocked after the initiation of refunds on September 8, 2023, or till the date of listing, depending on your bank's policies.
